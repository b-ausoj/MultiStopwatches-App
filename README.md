## Development Disclosure

The core application, including all features, UI/UX design, state management, and business logic, was developed independently without AI assistance throughout 2024 and earlier. In late 2025, AI tools (Claude) were used for specific technical tasks:

- Migrating the app from Android-only to web deployment
- Resolving Flutter framework and package compatibility issues after version updates
- Implementing internationalization and localization support

The fundamental architecture, feature implementation, and the majority of the codebase represent my independent work.
